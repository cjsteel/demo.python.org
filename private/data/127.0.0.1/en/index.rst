Python Programming Language
===========================

Python is an interpreted programming language with a simple syntax. It is easy to learn and it allows you to create new programs and to integrate existing components quickly and efficiently.

The main Python interpreter, written in C, runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and many other platforms. There are Python interepreters written in other languages (including Java and Python itself) and some targeting specific virtual machines and architectures (including .NET).

Python is free to use and to reditribute, even in commercial products, thanks to its
OSI-approved `open source license <http://docs.python.org/license.html>`_.

There are two majors versions of the Python language:
`Python 2.x and Python 3.x <http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>`_.
They are similar but not compatible. Python 2.x is more popular and counts more library.
Python 3.x is a newer and much improved version.

The `Python Software Foundation </psf/>`_ holds the
intellectual property rights behind Python, underwrites the PyCon
conference, and funds projects in the Python community.

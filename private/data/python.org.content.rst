**Ubuntu Linux:**

Ubuntu prefers the community to contribute work in Python. We develop
our own tools and scripts in Python and it's much easier for us to
integrate your work if you use the same platform.

**Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and
integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python
and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance
costs.**

Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and has been ported to
the Java and .NET virtual machines.

Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its
OSI-approved `open source license </psf/license/>`_.

New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read
`Python 2 or Python 3 <http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation </psf/>`_ holds the
intellectual property rights behind Python, underwrites the PyCon
conference, and funds other projects
in the Python community.
